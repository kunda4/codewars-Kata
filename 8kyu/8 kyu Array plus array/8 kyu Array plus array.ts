DESCRIPTION:
I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

    return arr1.reduce((acc,curr)=>acc+curr, 0) + arr2.reduce((acc,curr)=>acc+curr, 0); 
  }
