/**
DESCRIPTION:
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
 */

export function arrayDiff(a: number[], b: number[]): number[] {
  
    const myArr = []
    if(a.length === 0) return []
    
    for(let i of a){
        if(!b.includes(i)){
          myArr.push(i)
        }
    }
    return myArr;
  }
