/**
DESCRIPTION:
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

Find the unique number (this kata)
Find the unique string
Find The Unique
 */

function findUniq(arr) {
  // do magic
  let myArr = [];

  return +arr.filter((value) => {
    if (arr.indexOf(value) === arr.lastIndexOf(value)) {
      return value;
    }
  });
}
